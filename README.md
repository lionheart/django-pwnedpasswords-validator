`django-pwnedpasswords-validator` is a Django password validator that checks if a user-provided password exists in a data breach using the [Pwned Passwords v2 API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#PwnedPasswords). All provided password data is [k-anonymized][k-anonymous-url] before being sent to the API, so plaintext passwords never leave your server.

From https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#PwnedPasswords:

> Pwned Passwords are more than half a billion passwords which have previously been exposed in data breaches. The service is detailed in the [launch blog post](https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-306-million-freely-downloadable-pwned-passwords/) then [further expanded on with the release of version 2](https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2). The entire data set is [both downloadable and searchable online via the Pwned Passwords page](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords).

## Installation

django-pwnedpasswords-validator is available for download through [PyPi][pypi-url]. You can install it right away using pip.

```bash
pip install django-pwnedpasswords-validator
```

Then, add django-pwnedpasswords-validator to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'django_pwnedpasswords_validator'
)
```

Finally, add django-pwnedpasswords-validator to `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS`:

```python
AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
    ...
    {
        'NAME': "django_pwnedpasswords_validator.validation.PwnedPasswordValidator"
    }
]
```

#### Security Note

No plaintext passwords ever leave your server using django-pwnedpasswords-validator.

How does that work? Well, the Pwned Passwords v2 API has a pretty cool [k-anonymity][k-anonymous-url] implementation.

From https://blog.cloudflare.com/validating-leaked-passwords-with-k-anonymity/:

> Formally, a data set can be said to hold the property of k-anonymity, if for every record in a released table, there are k âˆ’ 1 other records identical to it.

This allows us to only provide the first 5 characters of the SHA-1 hash of the password in question. The API then responds with a list of SHA-1 hash suffixes with that prefix. On average, that list contains 478 results.

People smarter than I am have used [math](https://blog.cloudflare.com/validating-leaked-passwords-with-k-anonymity/) to show that 5-character prefixes are sufficient to maintain k-anonmity.

In short: your plaintext passwords are protected if you use this library. You won't leak any enough data to identity which passwords you're searching for.
